### More Information

My name is James Smith and I am a full-time software engineer as well as the creator of Socratic Development. As an avid consumer of podcasts, blogs, videos, books, and pretty much anything else which can improve me as a person and a developer, I decided to go out and grab my own little piece of the internet. My hope is that the content here will provide some insight and inspiration for others.
